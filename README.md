# Air Fryer Interest Form

## About Me

Hi, I'm **Charles Wilson**, a software engineer with a passion for building intuitive web applications. I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater, building on my B.S. in Computer Science and Data Science from Hamline University/Macalester College (Magna Cum Laude, 3.85 GPA).

With experience at **BoviSync** and **Ameriprise Financial**, I've developed full-stack applications using React, Python, and cloud technologies. My projects include BudgetBuddy (personal finance app), Movie Swiper (social movie matching), and a March Madness Predictor using machine learning.

## About This Project

This is a sleek, modern interest form for an upcoming air fryer product. Built with **React** and styled with **CSS**, it features:

- **Professional Design**: Clean, minimal aesthetic with subtle animations
- **Responsive Layout**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **User Experience**: Smooth form interactions with visual feedback
- **Modern Styling**: Professional color scheme with depth and hierarchy

The form collects contact information and includes a fun "guess the cost" feature to engage potential customers. It's designed to be both functional and visually appealing, reflecting my commitment to creating user-centered web experiences.
